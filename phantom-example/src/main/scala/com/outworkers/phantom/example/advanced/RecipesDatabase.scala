// In this section, we will show how you can create a real-world Cassandra service with com.outworkers.phantom.
// First you have to think of what queries you need to perform. The usual.
// Say you come up with id and author.

// You will end up with several mapping tables enabling you to do all the queries you want.
// Now you are left with maintaining consistency at application level.
// We usually overlay a service on top of the mapping tables.
// To keep all the complexity away from other parts of the application.

  /**
   * Right now you can go for a really neat trick of the trade.
   * You can automatically initialise all your tables using phantom's schema auto-generation capabilities.
   * We are using the same connector as the tables do, which will link to the exact same database session.
   *
   * The bellow example uses the Future.join method which Twitter specific and not available in the less advanced Scala API.
   * Nonetheless, if you are using Scala you can almost replicate the below with a Future.sequence or Future.traverse over a List.
   *
   * This is a very neat and simple trick which will initialise all your tables in parallel at any time you want. The initialisation will automatically
   * trigger the mechanism that connects to Cassandra and gives you back a session.
